Details:

Fuzzy Artwork Search
 - Load artwork by fuzzy match on filename
 - Set with fuzzy_artwork_search in the wahcade.ini

Lock File 
 - This fix locks user input when launching an emulator
 - This fix locks user input for a period of time (secs) after the emulator exits.
 - Set this with lock_time in the wahcade.ini

Additional Rom Extension Support
 - Multiple rom extensions may be specified and separated with a semicolon;
    - ie. smc;sfc;bin
 When a game is launch and this is recognised in the extension field of the ini the system will
 loop through the extensions whilst check if a file exists with each extension to set the correct 
 extension for the launched game. It will execute the first one found
 - Empty Rom Extension field
 Leaving the extension field empty will act as a wildcard and add all items in the rom path to the
 list. When executing a game the system will check for the first match of the rom title and execute.

Scrolled Game List
 - Can now be shrunk to a single row. Previous limit was minimum of 4 rows.

Non-Sequential Game Lists
 Game lists in wahcade were required to be numbered sequentially. This is no longer required 
 and mahcade will now read all lists matching the emulator name and cycle through them. This 
 has the advantage of allowing the user to delete old list file without modifying all others
 or use my tool at http://www.mameau.com/listgen to build filtered lists

*** My modified layout at 1024x576 version of the black retro skin included for netbooks ***

NOTE: support for standard wahcade/mamewah ini's should not be changed

Tested under UBUNTU 10.04/10.10 NBR
