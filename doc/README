Wah!Cade README
===============

Wah!Cade is a clone of the excellent MameWAH (http://mamewah.mameworld.net/)
front-end for the M.A.M.E. emulator (and others too).

Why clone MameWAH?  Because Wah!Cade works on GNU/Linux :o)

Configuring
===========
Please read the quick setup guide on the wahcade website:
    http://www.anti-particle.com/wahcade_quick.shtml


Notes:
------
* See the KEYS file for info on keyboard commands

* Wah!Cade uses MameWAH's config system, so if you have an existing MameWAH setup you can use
  a copy of it's various config files.  If so, you'll need to copy the following directories
  from an existing MameWAH installation into the ~/.wahcade directory:
       * ctrlr
       * files (optional)
       * ini
       * layouts
  See the INI_FILES file for more information.  Reading up on current MameWAH
  documention might help too.

* When running wahcade for the first time, it can be a little slow as
  it needs to peruse the huge mameinfo.xml file and create its initial
  game lists & filters.

* You can use a mameinfo.dat file instead of the preferred xml format, but be
  warned - it's much, much, *much* slower

* Some nice skins for MameWAH / Wah!Cade can be found at:
  http://localarcade.com/screenshotarchive/skins.htm

* to get movies to work, set the movie_preview_path and movie_artwork_no
  entries in ~/.wahcade/ini/<emu_name>.ini

* to mute movies, set the movie_volume entry to 0 in ~/.wahcade/wahcade.ini

* Any fonts that a layout requires should be installed first (e.g. for Gnome users,
  copy the font files into your ~/.fonts directory).

* Check the forums too: http://www.anti-particle.com/forum
