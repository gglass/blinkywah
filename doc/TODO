Rom Directory Enhancments:
    Postby spudgunman on 24 Oct 2008 07:01 am
    could I put in a feature request for recursive directory searching option for ROM directory
    for instance I have roms like:

    SNES
    ../USA
    ../Japan
    it would be nice if wahcade just found them all, (even cooler if it made lists for them each)
    Also multiple rom types, such as in gameboy that might be .gc or gx for gameboy color and gameboy orginal b/w but all run off the same emulator
    so for file type - ext1; ext2; ext3 ....

Game Lists:

    Make game list read only by checkbox for each game list (ie all games read only but "Kelly's Games" can be add/remove)
    Make Game Lists emulator wide, have games from multiple emulators in a list
